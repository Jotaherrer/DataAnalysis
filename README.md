# Overview

Thousands of data sources exist nowadays from which we can extract, transform and load data ranging stock prices, medical records, surveys, population census, and logged behaviors, among others. Also, thereâ€™s a huge variety of fields in which we can apply these techniques and a wide range of useful applications inside each field, such as fraud detection, credit scoring and asset allocation in relation to the finance domain

In this repo, I'll be including data analysis projects that I prepare which I'll update continuously. Feel free to make any suggestions or comment!
